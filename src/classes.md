0. Introduction of the course: inverse, learning and design problems

# Discrete Linear Inverse Problems

1. Formulation of discrete linear inverse problem `Gm=d`; Row and column interpretations of matrix-vector `Gm` and matrix-matrix `GH` products 
2. Overdetermined and underdeterminded systems; Linear (in)dependence, basis vectors; independence-dimension inequality
3. Left (right) inverses of a matrix with independent column (row) vectors; Gram matrix; pseudo inverses; solving linear equations with the inverses
4. Solving inverse problems via matrix factorization; `CR` Column times Row and `QR` factorizations
5. Example of fitting a polynomial using temperature anomaly data
6. Singular Value Decomposition; Factor Analysis; Examples from chemical analysis of ocean sediments, 
7. Aalysis of spatial patterns in atmospheric pressure - Assignment
8. Example from gravity inversion - Assignment 
9. Coordinate Descent Algorithm, Lasso, Ridge Regression, Elastic-Net (demonstrated using the gravity problem)
10. Example from seismic imaging: traveltime tomography
