0. Introduction of the course: inverse, learning and design problems

# Discrete Linear Inverse Problems

1. Formulation of discrete linear inverse problem `Gm=d`; Row and column interpretations of matrix-vector `Gm` and matrix-matrix `GH` products 
2. Overdetermined and underdeterminded systems; Linear (in)dependence, basis vectors; independence-dimension inequality
3. Left (right) inverses of a matrix with independent column (row) vectors; Gram matrix; pseudo inverses; solving linear equations with the inverses
4. Solving inverse problems via matrix factorization; `CR` Column times Row and `QR` factorizations
5. Example of fitting a polynomial using temperature anomaly data
6. Example from seismic imaging: traveltime tomography
