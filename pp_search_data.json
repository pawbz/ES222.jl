Step 2: Run Julia After installing,  make sure that you can run Julia . On some systems, this means searching for the “Julia  1.8.2 ” program installed on your computer; in others, it means running the command  julia  in a terminal. Make sure that you can execute  1 + 1 : Make sure that you are able to launch Julia and calculate  1+1  before proceeding! Step 3: Install  Pluto Next we will install the  Pluto , the notebook environment that we will be using during the course. Pluto is a Julia  programming environment  designed for interactivity and quick experiments. Open the  Julia REPL . This is the command-line interface to Julia, similar to the previous screenshot. Here you type  Julia commands , and when you press ENTER, it runs, and you see the result. To install Pluto, we want to run a  package manager command . To switch from  Julia  mode to  Pkg  mode, type  ]  (closing square bracket) at the  julia>  prompt: \njulia> ]\n\n(@v 1.8 ) pkg>\n The line turns blue and the prompt changes to  pkg> , telling you that you are now in  package manager mode . This mode allows you to do operations on  packages  (also called libraries). To install Pluto, run the following (case sensitive) command to  add  (install) the package to your system by downloading it from the internet.\nYou should only need to do this  once  for each installation of Julia: \n(@v 1.8 ) pkg> add Pluto\n This might take a couple of minutes, so you can go get yourself a cup of tea! You can now close the terminal. Step 4: Use a modern browser: Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome We need a modern browser to view Pluto notebooks with. Firefox and Chrome work best. Second time:  Running Pluto & opening a notebook Repeat the following steps whenever you want to work on a project or homework assignment. Step 1: Start Pluto Start the Julia REPL, like you did during the setup. In the REPL, type: julia> using Pluto\n\njulia> Pluto.run()\n The terminal tells us to go to  http://localhost:1234/  (or a similar URL). Let’s open Firefox or Chrome and type that into the address bar. If you’re curious about what a  Pluto notebook  looks like, have a look at the  Featured Notebooks . These notebooks are useful for learning some basics of Julia programming. If you want to hear the story behind Pluto, have a look a the  JuliaCon presentation . If nothing happens in the browser the first time, close Julia and try again. And please let us know! Step 2a: Opening a notebook from the web This is the main menu - here you can create new notebooks, or open existing ones. Our homework assignments will always be based on a  template notebook , available in this GitHub repository. To start from a template notebook on the web, you can  paste the URL into the blue box  and press ENTER. For example, homework 0 is available  here . Go to this page, and on the top right, click on the button that says “Edit or run this notebook”. From these instructions, copy the notebook link, and paste it into the box. Press ENTER, and select OK in the confirmation box. The first thing we will want to do is to save the notebook somewhere on our own computer; see below. Step 2b: Opening an existing notebook file When you launch Pluto for the second time, your recent notebooks will appear in the main menu. You can click on them to continue where you left off. If you want to run a local notebook file that you have not opened before, then you need to enter its  full path  into the blue box in the main menu. More on finding full paths in step 3. Step 3: Saving a notebook We first need a folder to save our homework in. Open your file explorer and create one. Next, we need to know the  absolute path  of that folder. Here’s how you do that in  Windows ,  MacOS  and  Ubuntu . For example, you might have: C:\\Users\\fons\\Documents\\18S191_assignments\\  on Windows /Users/fons/Documents/18S191_assignments/  on MacOS /home/fons/Documents/18S191_assignments/  on Ubuntu Now that we know the absolute path, go back to your Pluto notebook, and at the top of the page, click on  “Save notebook…” . This is where you type the  new path+filename for your notebook : Click  Choose . Step 4: Sharing a notebook After working on your notebook (your code is autosaved when you run it), you will find your notebook file in the folder we created in step 3. This the file that you can share with others, or submit as your homework assignment to Canvas. \nconst run = f => f();\nrun(async () => {\nconst versions = await (await fetch(`https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/versions.json`)).json()\nconst version_names = Object.keys(versions).sort().reverse()\nconst stable = version_names.find(v => versions[v].stable)\nconsole.log({stable})\nconst pkg_stable = /\\d+\\.\\d+/.exec(stable)[0]\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"auto-julia-version\").forEach(el => {\n    console.log(el)\n    el.innerText = el.getAttribute(\"short\") == null ? stable : pkg_stable\n})\n});"},{"url":"linear-algebra backup 1/","title":"Linear Algebra Primer","tags":[],"text":" A Pluto.jl notebook v0.19.36 frontmatter title \"Linear Algebra Primer\" description \"Refresh your concepts of linear algebra.

The modules in the file are specified as a vector of pairs, in the form module_id => module_title\n for example \"module1\" => \"Week 1: Introduction to the class\"\n To link a file to a module, you will need to add the module identifier in the page tags. For more info about this, see  Add frontmatter tracks.jl In this file you will specify tracks. Tracks can be used to group lectures across modules, e.g. if they have a commmon theme. When a track is selected on the sidebar, only the pages\nbelonging to that track will be highlighted. Similar to modules, tracks are stored in a vector of pairs in the form track_id => track_title\n for example \"julia\" => \"💻 Julia programming\"\n To link a file to a track, you will need to add the track id, prefixed with  track_ , to the tags of the page. For example, to add a lesson to the julia track defined above, you would add the tag  track_julia  to the tags of that lesson file.

Here you will place all your lecture materials. So let us take a closer look at this. Opening the  src  folder, you will see the following _data  folder: here you will place metadata about your website (university name, class semester, define tracks, etc.), more on this in the next lesson. _include : This folder contains the layout templates that are used to generate the final pages on your website. Unless you want to tweak the layout, you will not need to modify this. assets : in this folder you can place all attachements, such as your university logo and other pictures. The folder also contains the CSS and scripts used to render the website. That was for the “infrastructure part” of the website, the rest is content! To add new pages to your website, simply them under the  src  folder. You can group them in subfolders, as done in this template, but that is not a strict requirement. When downloading this template, you will get the following material: installation.md : this page contains instructions on how to install Julia and Pluto. If you find it useful, you may keep it as is, or edit to match your wanted installation instructions. cheatsheets.md : contains a list of julia related resources. Again, you can keep it or remove it. logistics.md : empty markdown page, where you can describe the logistics of your class index.jlmd : this is used to render the homepage.  Do not remove or modify this! search.md : this is used to render the search tab on the sidebar, do not modify or remove this file. The remaining folders mod1_setup_website mod2_add_material mod3_publish_website homework are placeholder samples, used to showcase what a deployed website looks like.

The function also takes an optional input `N` which is the number of samples to generate and is set to 100 by default. The function generates samples using the Metropolis Hastings algorithm, which is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo MCMC method. It initializes the first sample to `m0`, and then repeatedly generates a new candidate sample using the prior function. It then evaluates the likelihood of the candidate sample using the `L` function and computes the Metropolis Hastings ratio. If the ratio is greater than a randomly generated number from a Bernoulli distribution, the candidate sample is accepted as the next sample, and the process is repeated until N samples are generated or the loop breaks.

Each cell should contain 1 julia expression function definition, if statement, variable assignment, etc. . ```julia if rand 0.5 \"hi\" else \"there\" end ``` or ```julia a 1 ``` or ```julia function f return rand ^ 2 end ``` However , multiple expressions in the same cell are not allowed, for example ```julia a 1 b 2 a b ``` cannot be written in the same cell. You have two alternatives 1. Split it into multiple cells recommended to make reactivity better . 2. Wrap your staments inside a `begin ... end` or `let ... end` block. The difference is that the latter introduces a local scope, hence variables defined inside `let` are not visibles from outside. Reactivity Pluto is reactive This means that if you define a variable `a` in a cell, when you edit the variable value, all cells depending on that variable are automatically re evaluated. A few notes 1. As mentioned above, better to have a single variable assignment per cell, this will make the dependency graph slimmer and reactivity smoother. 2. Code modifying a given variable should be in the same cell, i.e. you cannot have two cells modifying the same variable.

For example, you use `Base.read` https docs.julialang.org en v1 base io network ~ text read filename%3A%3AAbstractString%2C%20String to access local data files inside your Julia code, and `Downloads.jl` https github.com JuliaLang Downloads.jl for remote data interwebs . `PlutoUI` helps you communicate with the person reading the notebook To get remote media URL inside your Markdown text , use `PlutoUI.Resource`. To get local media file inside your Markdown text , use `PlutoUI.LocalResource`. With media , we mean images , video and audio. We strongly recommend that you use remote media inside Pluto notebooks If your notebook uses local images, then those images will not show when someone else opens your notebook, unless they have the same images on their computer, at the exact same location.

Popular video sites don't give you that link, instead, you can use their embed codes . You can find these inside the video player, by right clicking or using the menu buttons. You then use that inside an HTML block ``` html\\\"\\\"\\\" ~ paste embed code here ~ \\\"\\\"\\\" ``` You might need to change the `width` to `100%` to make it fit.\" html\"\"\" div style \"padding 56.25% 0 0 0 position relative \" iframe src \"https player.vimeo.com video 438210156\" style \"position absolute top 0 left 0 width 100% height 100% \" frameborder \"0\" allow \"autoplay fullscreen\" allowfullscreen iframe div script src \"https player.vimeo.com api player.js\" script \"\"\" md\" LocalResource not recommended The examples above use `Resource` to make media from a URL available inside Markdown.

Go to imgur.com https imgur.com and drag&drop the image to the page. Right click on the image, and select \"Copy image location\". You can now use the image like so ```PlutoUI.Resource \"https i.imgur.com SAzsMMA.jpg\" ``` 2. If your notebook is part of a git repository, place the image in the repository and use a relative path ```PlutoUI.LocalResource \".. images cat.jpg\" ``` \"\"\" md\" Why does it have to be so difficult? Pluto only stores code in the notebook file, not images. This minimal file format is very valuable, but it means that images need to be addressed , not stored. Addressing local files is fragile if someone else opens the notebook, or if you move the notebook to a different folder, that image file needs to be available at exactly the same path. This is difficult to do correctly, and if it works for you, it is hard to tell if it will work for someone else. Putting images online might be a hassle, but once it works, it will work everywhere The stateless nature of URLs means that the images will work regardless of how the notebook file is accessed, while keeping a minimal file format.\" md\" PlutoUI without Pluto Huh? Did you know that you can run Pluto notebooks without Pluto ? If your notebook is called `wow.jl`, then ```sh julia wow.jl ``` will run the notebook just fine. When you use ` bind`, your notebook can still run without Pluto Sort of. Normally, all bound variables are assigned the value `missing` when you run it elsewhere. However, the `PlutoUI` types have all been configured to assign a more sensible default value. For example, if your notebook contains ```julia bind x Slider 10 20 ``` and you run it without Pluto, then this statement simply assigns `x 10`. \" md\"`Pluto` and `PlutoUI` work independently of each other In fact, you could write a package with fun input elements, or add ` bind`able values to existing packages.\" md\" Appendix\" space html\" br br br \" space space space space space "},{"url":"mod3_time_series/deploy_static/","title":"Deploy your website as static","tags":["module3","track_setup","deploy","netlify","github actions","github pages"],"text":"Deploying with github pages Deploying your website as static page with github pages is a breeze.
